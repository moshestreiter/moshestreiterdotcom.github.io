    Computer displays are composed of pixels, and each pixel is composed of 3 light emitting diodes(LED's). Each diode emits light in the frequency of one of the three primary colors, which are Red, Green, and Blue lights. The combination of these three LED's create the color of each individual pixel.</p>
    <p id="info" class="tab">    By combining these 3 primary color lights at various intensities, it is possible to create all the colors of the rainbow including black and white. Absolute black is the absence of all light, and absolute white light is the combination of all the primary colors at full intensity. Shades of gray are produced when all colors are of equal intensity, but while there is not absolute absence or full presence of light intensity, rather the light intensity is somewhere in between the poles of the bi-polar spectrum of intensity.</p>
    <p id="info" class="tab">    All colors can be produced by combining red, green, and blue light at varying intensities. For example, you get shades of orange when you combine red and green lights, and full yellow when red and green are at full intensity. Shades of yellow are produced by adjusting the blue light. Google 'RGB Calculator' if you would like to further explore these fascinating characteristics of light using a sliding rule to display all the various shades of color by adjusting the Red, Green, and Blue lights.</p>
    <p id="info" class="tab">    The 3 LED's in each pixel in your display can each be adjusted on a scale of 0 to 255, 0 being complete absence of intensity, and 255 being full intensity. This means that there are 16,777,216 possible shades of colors that can be displayed on your computer screen (256 × 256 × 256).</p>
    <p id="info" class="tab">    When you click 'Start' to begin the test, you will be prompted to enter the level of color differentiation that you would like to be tested on. Entering the number 1 would adjust one of the three LED's at random for one of the two squares at random by only 1 unit on the RGB scale from 0 to 255 compared to the second square (if the presented set of squares are different from each other). If your eyes would be capable of distinguishing between the two squares of colors at this level of 1 unit differential for all the questions on the test, then that would mean you are capable of seeing all possible 16,777,216 colors that can be displayed. Entering the number 2 would adjust the scales at random by 2 units, effectively halving the number of possible colors able to be seen. If you were able to distinguish the squares at level 2 then that would mean you can see about 8,388,608 shades of colors (16,777,216 / 2). Successfully completing level 10, for example, would mean you can see 1,677,722 colors.</p>
    <p id="info" class="tab">    Whether the two squares presented are different shades of colors or the same color is determined by the computer program at random. As well each set of colors, different or not, is determined at random. By taking the test you will learn that for some differing sets of squares you are able to easily perceive a difference, while other sets at the same level are not so easily distinguished. This demonstrates the wonderful diversity and mystery of our individual strengths and weaknesses in our perceptions of colors.</p>
    <p id="info" class="tab">    At the end of the test, if you score more than 75% you will be presented with an approximation of how many colors you are able to perceive based of the level of the test that was served, as well as taking into account the ratio of correct answers.</p>
    <p id="info" class="tab">    Without further ado, begin the test by clicking on 'Start' and then enter the level you would like to be tested at as a number (i.e. '1' or '5' or any number between 1 and 128, 1 being the most challenging and 128 being least challenging).</p><br>
    <p id="info" class="note">    Note 1.<br> If you are taking the test for the first time, it is suggested to start at a less challenging level like 20 or 30 or so and work your way up so as to get familiar with the nature of the test and to not get discouraged from the first try. Levels 1 – 10 can be very difficult especially to start out with, as the color differences are usually extremely subtle.</p><br>
    <p id="info" class="note">    Note 2.<br> If you find that you don't believe a set of squares are different and yet the test says they are, you can open the developers console for your browser (for the Google Chrome browser, click on View => Developer => JavaScript Console) and you can see the RGB scale for each square and confirm they are in actuality different from each other by the chosen level number in one of the primary colors in the RGB scale, however difficult to perceive on the screen. And yes, you can also 'cheat' the test this way, however as there are no prizes for this test at the moment other than the prize of knowing a personal approximation of how many colors you can see, you would only be cheating yourself of this knowledge! Also fyi, in a future version of this test there will be a leader board with the names of those who were able to see the maximum level of colors. In this future version the console will not display the RGB codes, and the source code will be encrypted as well.
